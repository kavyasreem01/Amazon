AMAZON CLONE PROJECT

A simple Amazon clone created with HTML, CSS and basic JS, designed to mimic the visual layout and core features of Amazon's homepage.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project replicates the front page layout of Amazon's e-commerce platform using HTML and CSS, with basic JavaScript for interactive elements like the cart, sign-in alert, and a back-to-top button. It includes a navigation bar, search bar, and a category section with mock product listings, allowing users to browse through different categories as they would on Amazon's real homepage.
